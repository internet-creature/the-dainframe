"""tool registry: the plug-in surface for agent capabilities.

each tool pairs a ToolDef (what the model sees) with an async handler (what
runs). handlers receive `stream_id` injected by the loop - the model never
sees or chooses whose stream it is acting on, which matters the moment there's
more than one user/session. new capabilities register here with zero changes
to the agent loop.
